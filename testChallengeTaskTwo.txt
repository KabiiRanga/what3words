Checklists:
1. Share action tab enabled on click
2. what3words is in sync with other sections (i.e search bar, url)
3. Able to copy what3words to clipboard
4. Validate the URL format of the default what3words displayed
5. Validate Menus of share settings and their child options
6. what3words content changes instantly based on combinations of Share Settings options selected
7. Validate navigations within Share Settings.
8. Validate navigations and contents sent via external apps.
8. Tab settings persists on page refresh/ switch to different tab/closing the tab.
9. Test this tab on different resolutions. 


Suggestions to PO:
1. Though all the share Settings are disabled, the app allowed to share empty content via any external apps (i.e facebook, email). I would like to suggest to allow default what3words content or disable external apps in this case to avoid user mistake.
2. Copy Link share options not providing any acknowlegment when copied.
